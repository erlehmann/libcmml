The /Win32 directory contains everything necessary to compile libcmml under windows and create

- libcmml.dll
- cmml-validate.exe
- cmml-fix.exe
- cmml-timeshift.exe
[- cmml-fortune.exe - not ported]


Building with the Makefile
==========================

Here's what you need to do:

1) Install libexpat.dll and the include file expat.h
 (you can get it from http://expat.sourceforge.net/)

2) cd Win32 subdirectory

3) Use "nmake" to create library and executable.

4) Install cmml-validate, cmml-fix, libcmml.dll and the include file cmml.h


Visual Studio.NET 2003 Installation
===================================

The VS.NET solution can be found in the Win32 subdirectory.

IMPORTANT: The solution files were built for VS.NET 2003 and can't be
opened by VS.NET 2002. If you use VS.NET 2002 you should use the VS6
workspace files and they will be automatically converted to the new
format.

Also included in the solution is a setup and deployment project that
will package and create an installer for the binary output of this
project.

You will need to install the expat libraries separately. If you wish
to create a debug build and wish to have the debugger load the symbols
for expat libraries, you should also include the expat project source
files that come with the expat package into the solution. By default
the compiler and linker will look for expat in the same parent
directory as libcmml. ie parent\expat\libs (for the library files) and
parent\expat\Source\lib (for the header files). However you can
install it wherever you choose and must modify the include directories
for the linker and compiler in your projects properties.

Visual Studio Version 6 Installation
====================================
NOTE: For lack of platform, we were not able to keep the Visual 
Studio Version 6 project files up-to-date. Send us an updated version 
if you're using these.
