 Just when you thought the Earth's ozone layer was safe
      from CFC chemicals, there's a new threat. Halon 1202. And while
      other damaging chemicals have been identified and banned, Halon
      1202 is not only increasing rapidly, we don't even know where
      it's coming from. This is Cape Grim in Tasmania, run by the
      Bureau of Meteorology, where CSIRO scientists collect what is
      probably the most pristine air in the world. From the air
      collected here, they can determine which pollutants there are in
      the atmosphere. Their measurements had indicated that damage to
      the ozone layer would decline over the next decade, but the
      discovery of the damaging Halon 1202 has made them reassess that
      time-table.

Halon 1202 has an ozone depletion potential approximately
      half that of the common CFC's, but it has increased six fold in
      the atmosphere since the late 1970's. In fact, during the past
      two years the atmospheric concentration of halon 1202 has been
      growing 17 per cent per year.

Dr Paul Fraser: "It's present in the atmosphere in quite
      small amounts currently, but the potential exists that it could
      rise quite rapidly and it is quite damaging to the ozone
      layer."

The halon 1202 could be a by-product from the production
      of other known halons, or it may indeed be being made
      deliberately for military applications.

Dr Paul Fraser: "The best way to stop halons increasing in
      the atmosphere is to have them included in the Montreal
      Protocol, which is an international agreement designed to limit
      the release of ozone depleting chemicals to the atmosphere."

When the Montreal Protocol was drawn up in 1987, only
      three halons were included, Halon 1202 was then unknown. And
      while the phasing out of CFC's and the known Halons is beginning
      to show results, the new Halon's growth could set back ozone
      recovery by up to ten years.
