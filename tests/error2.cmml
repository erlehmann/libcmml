A way we can store water so that water supplies will not be stressed during hot dry periods</a>

Urban water usage research: Australia is a dry continent and urban
communities use a lot of the available water. CSIRO has been working
on an urban water program. The objective is to find out how much water
use is costing the environment and what are the opportunities to
improve its use. Mike Young from CSIRO Land and Water believes we take
water for granted.
