DR. Tom Beer, CSIRO: "I see these being used in any
      situation where workers may be exposed to nitrogen dioxide and
      typical examples of that would be chefs working in an industrial
      kitchen, or workers in factories that have gas fired boilers. We
      have similar passive gas samplers that can measure ozone, that
      can measure sulphur dioxide, that can measure formaldehyde."
      


There are currently two thousand samplers being worn
      around the world. The information collected from these will be
      used by environmental managers to ensure that we have clean air
      inside as well as outside.
