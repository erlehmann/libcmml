	interface to CMML files.


Tools
-----

The libcmml source distribution comprises the C library libcmml
and the following command-line tools:

    * cmml-validate, which takes as input a CMML file and tests it

    * cmml-fix, which fixes a sloppily written input CMML and creates
      a valid one if possible

    * cmml-fortune, which creates a valid CMML file with random content

    * cmml-timeshift, which reads a CMML files and creates another one
      where all the clip tags are delayed by a time offset in seconds

Full documentation of the libcmml API, customization and installation,

 * provides structured annotations (meta tags) and unstructed
   annotations (free text) both for the complete media file and each
   clips
 * URI hyperlinks from clips to other Web resources possible
 * URI hyperlinks from clips to representative images (keyframes)
   possible
 * internationalisation (i18n) support for markup
 * multi-track composition directions for media files from several
   input media files possible
 * several tracks of annotations (multi-track annotations) possible
