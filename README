Libcmml is a library which enables the handling of documents
written in CMML (Continuous Media Markup Language) for the
Continuous Media Web (CMWeb).  You will need the expat library 
installed to compile libcmml.

It provides a very simple API for reading files marked up with the
Continuous Media Markup Language (CMML), and returns C structures
containing this information in a format which can be used by an
Annodexer for creating ANNODEX(tm) format documents (ANX).

The src/ directory contains the source code for the library itself.

The tools/ directory contains some programs which link against libcmml
and are useful for validating and beautifying CMML documents.

The doc/ directory contains some documentation for CMML. The
subdirectory libcmml is autocreated by doxygen from comments contained
in the source code.

The examples/ directory contains some simple example programs to
demonstrate how to use libcmml.

The tests/ directory contains some CMML sample documents for checking
the correctness of the library. Run "make check" to test.

The Win32/ directory contains the files necessary to compile the
library for MS Windows using nmake.

This library is installed using the standard configure, make, make
install sequence. Full details in the file INSTALL.

Read the file README.win32 for installing under MS Windows.
